#Object Oriented Programming TeamWork:
##Project Description
Design and implement an object-oriented application by choice. It could be a simple game (e.g. Minesweeper, Tetris, Xonix or other), component library (windows, buttons, text boxes, menus, etc.), business application (e.g. car store, auction, movie rental, bug tracker, knowledge management system, e-library, text editor), or any other. You are absolutely free to choose the topic of your work.
##General Requirements
--------------------
Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:
*	At least 3 interfaces (with one or more implementations)
*	At least 10 classes (implementing the application logic)
*	At least 1 abstract class (with inheritors)
*	At least 1 exception class (with usage in your code)
*	At least 1 structure
*	At least 1 enumeration
*	At least 2 events (with subscribers)
*	At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command, Iterator, …)
You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others.
##Additional Requirements
*	Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
*	Obligatory use Team Foundation Server (TFS) to keep your source code and for team collaboration. SVN or Git are not allowed. Use TFS.
*	Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types).
##Optional Requirements
----------------------
If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:
*	Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.)
*	Constants, generic types, indexers, operators
*	Lambda expressions and LINQ
*	Implementation of IEnumerable<T>, ICloneable, ToString() override
*	Namespaces (if your classes are too much)
